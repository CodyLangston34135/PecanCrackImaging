# Pecan Crack Imaging

This is a lab grown matlab codebase used to detect, classify, and measure pecan cracks from .mp4 videos of pecans rotating on a white background.
This codebase requires a specific rotation jig to use and is mainly here for internal lab usage for future projects.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Probably some statistics toolbox, idk
